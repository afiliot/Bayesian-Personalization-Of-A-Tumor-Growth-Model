# Bayesian-Personalization-of-a-Tumor-Growth-Model

In this project, we propose implement Lattice Boltzmann Method and Crank Nicholson scheme to simulate the growth of a particlarly infiltrative tumor : grade IV gliomas, also called glioblastomas mutliformes (GBM). This implementation is based on the article "MRI Based Bayesian Personalization of a Tumor Growth Model", from LÃª et al. (2016). We use the MNI atlas to apply our growth model to real MRI (http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/ServicesAtlases/ICBM152NLin2009). The equation under scrutiny is the so called FKPP (Fisher, Kolmogorov, Petrovsky, Piscounov) equation:

We use our simulations to recover the results from the Spherical Asymptotic Analysis from Harpold et al. (2007), "The evolution of mathematical modeling of glioma proliferation and invasion".
